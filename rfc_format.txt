Abstract
In this group work, we take a look at the challenges faced by space
communication. More and more exploration of the Mars means better
forms for communication like, the transfer of packets from Earth to
Mars. Different factor affects the smooth packet transfer such as
time, distance and Sun. Due to distance from Earth to Mars, some
packets are damaged, and these damaged packets requires
retransmission. The retransmission is addressed in a way that, it
should take less time to be retransmitted.

1. Introduction
The constant growth in technology gives the ability for extreme
discoveries and explorations. One of this very ambitious exploration,
is the settling of humans in Mars in the nearest future. Before now,
lots of different space expeditions have been carried out, and this
therefore means the explorers have to communicate with people on
Earth. Space communication has been a very big challenge when it
comes to transfer of data, based on vary factors, for example
distance.
The distance from Earth to Mars is very vast and the time taken from
Earth to Mars differs. Both the Earth and Mars do orbit the Sun which
also makes it challenging for communication due to noise produced by
the Sun. The transfer of packets from Earth to Mars can sometimes
fail and retransmission is needed. The idea of retransmission can
lead to huge latencies which make human-to-human interaction greatly
unbearable.
In this group work, a solution is proposed to address the problem of
overall communication latency between Earth and Mars. The problem is
latency based on retransmission. To address latency, we must address
retransmissions.
The solutions we propose are: forward error correction (FEC) and the
use of relay stations. Both combined should reduce the number of
retransmissions needed and also the time spent for each
retransmission.
2. Challenges
Setting up a communication between Earth and Mars is not really a
trivial matter because of the wide varieties of obstacles such as
vast distance between Earth and Mars, noise from the Sun, long time
delays and other disturbances. However, mainly our concerns are the
vast distance from Earth to Mars, noise from the Sun and long time
delays.
2.1. Vast Distance
In communication systems, distance plays a vital role. It's
particularly tricky when trying to communicate between Earth and Mars
since the distance between the two planets can be anywhere between
50-400 million km. The actual distance depends on where Earth and
Mars are respectively in their orbit around the Sun [1].
Hence, the signal needs to travel approximately aforementioned
distance to reach Mars. We know the speed of light is 3x10 km/sec.
Assuming the signal travels at the speed of light, it takes
approximately 3 to 30 minutes for the information to reach the other
end.
3. Proposed Solution
Data propagation between Earth and Mars can be anywhere from 3 to 30
minutes. This is assuming there are no errors in transmission which
is highly unlikely. With errors, there will be additional delays due
to retransmissions.  With retransmissions, the overall latency can be
up to 75 minutes.  To make any sort of human-to-human interaction
reasonable, the overall latency needs to be 45 minutes or less.
The proposed solution aims to meet this latency requirement by using
Forward Error Correction in the transmitted data and also by adding
multiple relay stations between Earth and Mars.
3.1. Forward Error Correction
Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a sort of self-correcting
algorithm. In telecommunication, information theory, and coding
theory, FEC or channel coding is a technique used for controlling
errors in data transmission over unreliable or noisy communication
channels. The central idea is the sender encodes the message in a
redundant way, most often by using an error-correcting code (ECC)
[2].
FEC involves transmitting extra data so that certain errors can be
corrected without data being retransmitted. This approach depends on
a measure called Hamming Distance. It is a metric for comparing two
bit strings of the same length. For example consider the following
two bit strings 000 and 011. The Hamming distance between these two
is two strings of equal length is simply the number of positions in
which their values differ. So the first are both 0s, but then we have
a 0 and a 1, so that is one position where they differ. And the last
position they also differ. So the distance between these two bit
strings: d(000, 011)=2. Given this knowledge, we can talk about
forward error correction.
Thus, FEC error correction increases the tolerance for errors. With a
higher tolerance for errors, there will be less need for
retransmission. And less retransmission means less latency.
3.2. Relay Stations
The proposed relay stations operate in a similar way to intermediate
stations in store and forward. Store and forward is a telecommunications
technique in which information is sent to an intermediate station where
it is kept and sent to the final destination or to another intermediate
station. The intermediate station verifies the integrity of the message
before forwarding it [3].
When relay stations are introduced in communications between Earth and
Mars, retransmissions will be with relay stations. This significantly
reduces the distances involved, and therefore reduces the retransmission
time. That in turn will reduce the overall latency.
The more relay stations that can be deployed between Earth and Mars, the
less distance, and therefore time, there will be between
retransmissions. Furthermore, the reduced distance between transmissions
will cause fewer errors, which will reduce the need for retransmission.
The number of relay stations, where they will be located, and how they
will be deployed, requires further study and is not within the scope of
this proposal. Enough satellites will be deployed as necessary to
maximise the efficiency.
One example would be to deploy 9 relay stations. With 9 relay stations,
we are essentially dividing the distance into 10 chunks.  That means the
distance between transmission hops will only be one tenth distance
between Earth and Mars. In other words, instead of 400 million
kilometres, it will be 40 million kilometres. And this is only when the
two planets are furthest from each other.

Appendix
"include a "FEEDBACK" section in your final submission text where you
may provide information about which reviews you did take into
consideration, and which you have rejected, and why. You may choose
any number of reviews (e.g. if you have too many to consider)."

1.	"The first two pages follow the styling nicely, after which for
seemingly no reason proper formatting disappears into thin air..."
We hope we have done better this time with the formatting.

2.	"For example in the third chapter, it is said that a 50% overhead
would make sending the data take 50% longer. This is likely not
true."
We have removed this statement, because the explanation was
misleading.
3.	"How is the proposed retransmission handled?"
The retransmission is between each hop and because the relay station
operates at the TCP level. That means that the FEC in combination
with the shorter distance between hops should greatly reduce the need
for retransmission. But even if retransmission is needed, the shorter
distance will introduce significantly less delay compared to
retransmissions between Earth and Mars.
4.	"Another note, include proper sources. A google search is not a
valid source, find the information on the NASA website and link that
with proper syntax."
We have addressed this in the final submission.

2. "Protocol is well explained and documented, it's easy to
understand and it addressess the initial problem well except for the
fact that it doesn't explain properly how the Relay Stations should
be positioned on the space. This is a quite important problem to
solve for the initial exam assignment, since the positioning of Mars
and Earth relative to Sun plays a key part in the communication
(latency and packet loss) problems that arise between an
interplanetary communication between Mars and Earth. To solve this
problem, I suggest the writers to take a look on the Exam assignment
Proposal 10 [1] Chapter 3.2.1. and the article mentioned [2] on that
Chapter."
Agree that it is very important and the whole thing fails without it,
but it is beyond the scope of this proposal as it is a physical
transmission issue and because the exact words of the teacher to me
were:
"You are not expected to solve the physical layer problem. [...] How
the physical and link layers work is "not your problem" in all
aspects except for retransmissions."
Thrusters use power constantly. How do you supply enough fuel? And
it's out of the scope of the assignment, at least according to the
teacher, it's out of the scope.

3. "Key problems: - The given solution doesnt address the problem
with using TCP/IP application layer with a propagation delay of up to
30 minutes. As suggested in the given task, couldn't the solution use
some kind of proxy server to bring the data closer to Mars? Of course
the data stored on the proxy server will become stale and need
updating, but this wouldn't be a problem for some applications."
Our solution uses relay stations that operate at the TCP layer.
